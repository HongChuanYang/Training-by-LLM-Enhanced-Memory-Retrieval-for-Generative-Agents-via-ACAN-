# Training-by-LLM-Enhanced-Memory-Retrieval-for-Generative-Agents-via-ACAN-
This repository contains the code for the paper "Training by LLM: Enhanced Memory Retrieval for Generative Agents via an Auxiliary Cross Attention Network". Our work introduces a novel approach to memory retrieval for generative agents, leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs) to enhance the effectiveness and precision of memory recall in complex agent-based simulations.
